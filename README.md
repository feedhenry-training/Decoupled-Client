# Decoupled Builds
This project shows the project layout used for building a FeedHenry application decoupled from the build farm using native SDK's for Cordova.

# Porting to your project
Copy the directory structure, remembering index.html now needs it's full structure including `<html>` and `<body>` tags.  
Don't forget the .gitignore file into your new repo - it contains some important lines to keep temporary android and xcode files, along with the WWW directories of both projects out of the repo  
You'll need to include the feedhenry JS SDK and init it, as in index.html - remember to switch to targeting live cloud code in release (see index.html). You might want to rename the native projects - at the moment it's called 'Decoupled'. Especially the product name, as that shows up on device once installed.  

# Usage
To copy the files into the native projects  
1.  npm uninstall -g grunt # remove previous version of grunt if any  
2.  npm install -g grunt-cli # install grunt cli globally  
3.  npm install . # run this from the root of the project to install required dependencies locally  
4.  grunt build # run this from the root of the project to copy the contents of client/default/* to the respective directories  
Then, to run the project, open the Xcode project in XCode, and add the android project in Eclipse as an existing project.  

# Init FH JS SDK
To init the FH JS sdk you must update $fh.init inside [`index.html`](https://github.com/learnhenry/Decoupled-Client/blob/master/client/default/index.html)  

The options you need to change are:  
*host* - Host to use, i.e. https://apps.feedhenry.com  
*appid* - Your App ID, used to identify your app.  
*appkey* - Your App API Key  

You can collect all this information from the details section of your app in the app studio.  

```javascript
$fh.init({
  "host": "https://apps.feedhenry.com",
  "appid": "myAppId",
  "appkey": "myAppKey"
}, function(res) {
  // Init call was successful. Alert the response
  alert('Got response from init:' + JSON.stringify(res));
}, function(msg, err) {
  // An error occured during the init call. Alert some debugging information
  alert('Init call failed with error:' + msg + '. Error properties:' + JSON.stringify(err));
  });
```

To read more about $fh.init please vist our
[docs site](http://docs.feedhenry.com/v2/api_js_client_api.html#$fh.init).

# Support
This project has been tested on OSX in part on Windows - it should support both.  
Upgrading to a new version of Cordova/Phonegap is easy - just replace the JS files in resources/cordova/ios (and android) directories and they'll get copied across by the build task.
